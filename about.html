  <!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
  <div class="about-content">

    <p>
      Windwood Designs began as a simple desire to understand the language of wood — the way grain flows, the way light moves across a carved surface, the way a piece slowly reveals what it wants to become. Over the years, that curiosity turned into a practice: carving, shaping, refining, and listening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of the work on this site was created in the late 1990s and early 2000s, during a period of deep experimentation. Some pieces were carved entirely by hand. Others blended early digital tools with traditional woodworking techniques. All of them were guided by the same intention: to create objects that feel alive, grounded, and quietly meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Windwood Designs is less about production and more about preservation — gathering the work, honoring the process, and sharing the pieces that still resonate. This site is a place to revisit that journey, to archive the craft, and to offer a glimpse into the creative path that shaped it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for taking the time to explore these pieces. May they bring a moment of stillness, curiosity, or inspiration — the same qualities that shaped them.
