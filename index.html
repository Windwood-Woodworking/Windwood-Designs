      <h2 class="section-title">Philosophy</h2>

      <p class="philosophy-text">
        Wood tells the truth.<br><br>
        Meaning arrives slowly, like dew settling on a morning surface.
        Notice the small pull and follow it without explanation.
        A felt direction is often truer than a planned route.<br><br>
        Listen for the quiet thread that asks to be followed.
        Form appears when attention softens and stays present.
        Resonance is a gentle alignment, not a loud proclamation.<br><br>
        Discovery happens in the space between looking and doing.
        Truth often arrives as a subtle confirmation, not a revelation.
        The world offers hints; we only need to be willing to receive them.<br><br>
        Presence shapes what unfolds, one quiet gesture at a time.<br><br>
        Every board has a story — grain, tension, scars, and surprises.
        My job is to listen, shape, and reveal what’s already there.
